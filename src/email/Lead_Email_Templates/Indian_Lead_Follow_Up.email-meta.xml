    <textOnly>Hello {!Lead.FirstName},


Thank you for your responses to our Expert Qualification Survey!

Unfortunately, we are unable to work with an independent contractor located in India right now.

If you are independent and are interested in working with 10K, please let us know and we can potentially make an introduction to our teams in India.

If you own a Salesforce development company with more than 10 employees, please let us know and we can follow up.

Thank you again!

Respectfully,
Jared</textOnly>

    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

2017 is fast approaching and I wanted to make sure I said &quot;Thank you!&quot; before the year is over. 2016 has been great and we are very excited for all that we will accomplish in 2017!

There will be many positive changes coming your way in 2017. We will be launching a new website, improving the 10K Community, and adding more opportunities for learning and collaboration.

Our 10K Experts are the best of the best and we are proud to have you aboard!

Thank you for all of your work in 2016 and we are looking forward to 2017!

Happy New Year,

From the 10K Advisor&apos;s Team</textOnly>

    <subject>10K Expert Referral Program - Thank you!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello!

Thank you to all our experts for embracing our referral program! It is great to see the activity on the social networks!

As a reminder, you can locate the social media links (with embedded messaging) on your Community Profile under the Referrals tab.


We&apos;d love it if you use #10K Connect in your messaging to promote 10K Advisors wherever you see fit.


Please note - we are unable to work with independent experts in India at the moment. If you know of someone in India who should join us, please reach out to us separately!


Thank you!

Jared

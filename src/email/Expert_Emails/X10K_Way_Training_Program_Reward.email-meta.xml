    <textOnly>Hello!

Since we launched last week, we’ve had 4 team members earn the 10K Way badge! Congratulations to our early adopters!

I wanted to remind you that we are looking for you to complete the course by July 15 but as an extra incentive, we’re offering a special reward to all who complete the course by July 7!  Don&apos;t miss out!

    <textOnly>Hello!

We are very excited to share May 2017 Release notes! There&apos;s a lot of new and cool functionality at your disposal to help you be the best 10K Expert possible and provide our clients with outstanding quality and service.

Some quick highlights are below but check out the full set of information in the May 2017 Release Notes Knowledge Article.

10K Way Knowledge Articles (https://10k.force.com/10kcommunity/s/article/ka136000000OMVPAA4/Article-List) are now available in the Community - The 10K Way is a collection of processes, standards, and best practices for managing and delivering client projects successfully. 10K Way is comprised of four components: Onboarding, Communication, Delivery Practices, and Feedback.

The 10K Way Article List (https://10k.force.com/10kcommunity/s/article/ka136000000OMVPAA4/Article-List) is part of the 10K Way Training Plan that will be rolled out to all Experts in the coming weeks. Get ahead of the game by pre-reading or use as reference material when onboarding new experts and working with clients.


Escalation Process - Experts can now use a form to escalate issues to Delivery Management.

The escalation process ensures open and honest communication with clients and 10K that assists Experts with items of concern. Escalations are raised immediately with 10K Delivery Management and will be addressed as quickly as possible.


Weekly Project Status Communication with Client - Project and Tech Leads now have the ability to send a weekly status report to clients from the 10K Org

In order to keep the client apprised of progress on work performed by you and/or your team, it is essential that we do a weekly update via a Project Status Report. Now, you have an easy way to update and send the Project Status Report!


We&apos;ve also included some highlights about upcoming functionality and features that will be released in June/July.


Let us know your thoughts and questions. We truly appreciate your feedback!



Thanks,

Jared

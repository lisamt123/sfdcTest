    <textOnly>Hello!

We are very excited to announce that we have created a Timecard entry screen for you to enter your time. This was built to reduce the amount of time it takes to enter your time on a daily basis.

When you now login to the 10K Community, you will notice a Timecard tab:

Click on this tab to access your Timecard.

When you are in your Timecard, you will notice:
-All your Active Assignments on the left hand side (in blue)
-The ability to scroll between weeks (in orange)
-Each cell represents a day where you can add multiple time entries per day (in red)


Please feel free to contact me with any feedback or questions!

Jared

    <subject>10K Community Update - Story Status!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello!

In our effort to increase our communication and visibility within the community, we have updated the &quot;Status&quot; field on Stories.

If you are currently using Stories, these changes will be live for you on April 2. If you are NOT using Stories and would like to, please log a case within the community.

This is the first of other changes that you will begin seeing the community around our delivery standards and processes!

Below, you will find the order and definition of our new Status values.




Draft: Story is under construction by Functional Owner or 10K Delivery Owner

Backlog: Story is complete but is not yet in scope or in a sprint

Ready for Work: Requirements are complete and 10K delivery starts the process of working on the story

In progress: Work to fulfill the requirements is under way including task assignments.

Blocked: Development cannot proceed until an item has been resolved. This is a temporary status and every effort should be made to move from this status.

Ready for QA: Only used if QA Owner assigned: Story is ready for testing that development meets requirements

Ready for Tech Review: Development and unit testing (and QA if applicable) have been completed and story meets Client and 10K Way standards

Ready for Review: Development is complete and is ready for client review

Ready for UAT: Client uses this status to indicate that the story is ready for User Acceptance Testing

UAT Complete: Client updates when testing has finished and all issues are resolved.

Ready for Deployment: Story has been determined to be ready for deployment based on the client deployment plan and should be readied for moving to the target org.

Completed: Work has been completed and client has signed off on the work deployed in the story.

Cancelled: The requirements or work outlined in the story is no longer required or relevant.

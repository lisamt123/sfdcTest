    <textOnly>Hello {!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you for being one of the first people to register as a Salesforce Expert!

My name is Jared Miller and I will be your main point of contact at 10K Advisors.

Over the next few weeks, I will be reaching out to schedule some time for us to talk. The conversation will be 15-30 minutes and we will discuss your Salesforce experience and the 10K Community. We are very excited to build this community and appreciate your patience!

In the meantime, please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments that you have.

Thank you again and I look forward to connecting.

Jared

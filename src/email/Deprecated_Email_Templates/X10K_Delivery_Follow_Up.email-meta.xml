    <textOnly>Hello {!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you again for expressing interest as an Expert with the 10K Community.

Based on your profile, I would like to schedule a call with you where we can talk about the 10K Community and I can learn more about your background and how we can help.

Please let me know a few times that will work for us to talk over the next 2 weeks, or you can visit and schedule a conversation here - calendly.com/jared-10k.

Thanks again and I look forward to speaking with you!

Jared

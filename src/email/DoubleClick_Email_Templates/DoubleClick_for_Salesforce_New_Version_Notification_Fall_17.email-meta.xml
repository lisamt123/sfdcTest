    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I&apos;m pleased to announce that we&apos;ve wrapped up the next version of the DoubleClick for Salesforce connector. This release contains a number of improvements, including:

 - Corrected a bug which sent Account data to DFP incorrectly during mass updates in Salesforce
 - Support for custom fields in the Proposal Line Item sync
 - Automatically pushing Agencies when pushing a new Opportunity to DFP
 - Allowing manual Line Item syncs even when the scheduled sync is already running

The full release notes are available at the link below, as well as in the 10K Community under the Knowledge tab.

Our target timeline for the upgrade is:

 - Sandboxes on or before December 8th
 - Production on or before December 22nd

I&apos;ll create a Case in the 10K Community where we can coordinate specific times to manage the upgrades in each of your environments, starting with the sandbox.

Please review the release notes, and let me know of any feedback or questions.

Thanks,
Matt

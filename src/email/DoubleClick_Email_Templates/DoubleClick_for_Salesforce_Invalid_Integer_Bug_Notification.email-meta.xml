    <subject>10K DoubleClick for Salesforce - Invalid Integer Bug Notification</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

This afternoon we received two reports of a bug that has the potential to impact all DoubleClick for Salesforce users. The issue comes up under the following circumstances:

A new Account is pushed to DSM, and a 10-digit DoubleClick Id is generated for that newly created Company, and successfully stored on the Account in Salesforce.
An Opportunity is created in Salesforce against this Account.
When the user tries to push that Opportunity to DSM, they&apos;ll receive an error for &quot;System.TypeException: Invalid integer: 4XXXXXXXXXX for field:CompanyId&quot; (where 4XXXXXXXXXX is the 10-digit DoubleClick Id of the Opportunity&apos;s Account)

At the moment we understand this issue to impact only pushing Opportunities to DSM for Accounts that are newly created in DSM, and assigned a 10-digit DoubleClick Id.

We have a high level understanding of the root cause, and will be working on a fix in the connector code tonight. Once we have a fix made, we&apos;ll release a new version of the connector and perform the upgrade in your sandbox for testing.

Provided we can get the fix made tonight, we will target having this new version of the connector in your sandbox by mid-day US time tomorrow (Friday June 16).

I will keep you posted as we progress through this issue resolution process. Please contact me if you have any questions in the mean time.

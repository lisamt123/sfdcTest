    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I&apos;m pleased to announce that we&apos;re wrapping up testing on the next release of the DoubleClick for Salesforce connector. This release contains several key enhancements, including:

 - Stabilize the Proposal and Proposal Line Item sync services, reducing the likelihood of the jobs halting and restarting in the middle of a sync unexpectedly
 - Upgrades to the scheduled sync jobs so they can restart themselves if they fail unexpected
 - Remove deleted Proposal Line Items from Salesforce during the scheduled sync
 - Sync Cost Adjusted Proposal Line Items as $0 Opportunity Line Items

The full release notes are available at the link below, as well as in the 10K Community under the Knowledge tab.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dpv8br9hYPavE18VJTiMz7cXEFiM17_VTrQz6ydkQ38/edit#

Our target timeline for the upgrade is:

 - Sandboxes on or before May 28th
 - Production on or before June 11th

When the final testing of the release is wrapped up in the next couple of days, we&apos;ll create a Case in the 10K Community to notify you that the package is ready to go, and to coordinate a time when we can upgrade your Sandbox.

In the mean time, please review the release notes, and let me know of any feedback or questions.

Thanks,
Matt

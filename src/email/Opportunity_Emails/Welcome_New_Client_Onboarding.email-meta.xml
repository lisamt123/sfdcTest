    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},



Let me be the first to welcome you aboard 10K! We are excited to be working with you on {!Opportunity.Name}.


As part of the onboarding process, I wanted to give you an idea of what to expect from us and what you can be doing to prepare for launching your project.


10K Activities:

Identifying the 10K Experts to fill the roles we’ve discussed

Planning your project start date

Creating a short video tour of 10K Connect so you can get familiar with our platform

Setting you up with 10K Connect (community) logins

Adding you and your team to {!Opportunity.Account}@10kview.com Google Group

Setting up a Google Drive folder for {!Opportunity.Account} for document sharing

Providing you with 10K User Name and Email address for SFDC Org credentials



{!Opportunity.Account} Activities:

Determine the {!Opportunity.Account} team members who will be involved in the project and their role on the project

Identify and collect documentation that will be valuable for 10K to understand your SFDC org, business processes, etc.

Set up or identify the development environment(s) where you want us to work

Provide access to environments (dev, test, UAT, production, etc)

Review the attached information about 10K Expert Roles and Responsibilities

Respond to 10K Client Onboarding Survey



The 10K Client Onboarding Survey provides an easy and efficient way to collect vital information that helps us execute on the above items. It will take about 5 minutes for you to complete and will get us out of the gate quickly.


You will hear from me within 48 hours to continue the onboarding process with a meeting to review your priorities and timing. Look for another email with the promised 10K items after we’ve processed your onboarding inputs.


Thanks for your confidence in 10K to help you with your Salesforce needs.</textOnly>

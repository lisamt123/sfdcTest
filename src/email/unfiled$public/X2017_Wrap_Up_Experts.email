<p style="line-height:18px; font-size:12px; padding:0px 5px;">What a great year 2017 has been!!!</p>
<p style="line-height:18px; font-size:12px; padding:0px 5px;">Together, we’ve accomplished so much! Here are a few highlights:</p>
<p style="line-height:18px; font-size:12px; padding:0px 5px;">
<ul style="font-size:12px;">
<li>Altogether, 10K Experts delivered over 47,000 hours for the year! Experts in the Developer role delivered the most hours, totaling over 31,000.</li>
<li>We introduced The 10K Way in conjunction with 10K Climb to make delivery processes more predictable and consistent.</li>
<li>The 10K Store was opened for business along with ways to earn points that can be exchanged for 10K gear.</li>
<li>Expert-to-Expert Feedback was developed as a way to help 10K Experts continuously improve both as individuals and as part of how they work with other team members.</li>
</ul></p>
<p style="line-height:18px; font-size:12px; padding:0px 5px;">And we have lots of new initiatives in the pipeline for 2018! To name a few:</p>
<p style="line-height:18px; font-size:12px; padding:0px 5px;">
<ul style="font-size:12px;">
<li>An easy to use release management application integrated into 10K Connect.</li>

<li>Metadata backup and comparison tools integrated into 10K Connect.</li>
<li>Lots of new learning and implementation opportunities for AppExchange applications.</li>
<li>A completely new UX for 10K Connect.</li>
</ul></p>

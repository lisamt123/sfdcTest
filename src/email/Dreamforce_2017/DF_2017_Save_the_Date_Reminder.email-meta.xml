    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}{!CampaignMember.FirstName}!

We&apos;d like to invite you to start your Dreamforce 2017 off with a bang at the inaugural 10K Dreamforce kick-off party. We are hosting an exclusive event that will include wine, cocktails, and appetizers as well as a very limited tasting of a number of rare bourbons from the 1950s to the 1990s that you won&apos;t want to miss! This event is limited to 10K clients and experts and will be a great opportunity to interact with 10K community members from around the world.

We will be mingling at a secret (for now) location in San Francisco on Monday, November 6 from 6:30 to 9:30 PM. We are trying our best to ensure we give all invitees an opportunity to taste from our selection of rare bourbons, so please let us know if you&apos;ll be able to attend so that we can accommodate accordingly. There will be more details to come as Dreamforce approaches.

RSVP for 10K Dreamforce Kick-off Party

Thank you for your continued support, and we hope to see you at Dreamforce!

    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your interest in working with 10K! As we discussed, we&apos;re evaluating a select few ISV partners who are interested in building a community of advocates and implementation experts for their products.

Please use this link: https://www.getfeedback.com/r/rrIxwznN?AccountName={!Account.Name} to take a survey that is your first step in the process.

Once the survey is complete, we will continue your onboarding by:

Collecting and reviewing your existing product documentation
Coordinating a demo of your app
Reviewing your implementation methodology in more detail

We are excited to be working with you! Please let us know if you have any questions.
